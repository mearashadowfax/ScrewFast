## What is a ***Un***conference?

An unconference is a participant-driven meeting that avoids conventional conference aspects like high fees and top-down organization.
It encourages active involvement through topic suggestions, session scheduling, and discussions.\
[More on Unconferences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference#Styles_of_facilitation).

## Organizing a Spryker Unconference
Thank you for (your interest in) organizing a Spryker event! Here are some tips and guidelines:

### General organization
* Events should be open to anyone interested in Spryker, including competitors.
* Avoid date conflicts with other Spryker events in your region. Check the CommerceQuest events overview.
* If organized by a company, moderate promotion is acceptable but avoid turning it into a commercial pitch.
* As the local organizer, you are the main contact for speakers and attendees.

### Facilities
* Make sure to have a working coffee machine ☕️ or a backup ⚡️.
* Have name badges/stickers, at least for day 1
* Bring enough post-its (or session template printouts) and markers for the Wall (see below)

### Content/ Topics
* Content is participant-driven, but you can suggest topics and have a keynote or workshop to kick off.
* Sessions can be proposed and voted on by participants.

### Announcing the event 
* Contact your Spryker representative or fill out this contact form.
* Be clear about your target audience to manage expectations.

## During the event
* Facilitate session proposals, pitches, voting, and scheduling.
* Encourage active participation and adherence to the law of two feet: if you’re not learning or contributing, move to a different session.

### Participant rules
For an unConferenceence to be succesful ALL participants need to be mindful and supportive of a few basic rules:

* Everyone is a participant and must engage actively.
* Follow basic unconference principles: whoever comes are the right people, and when it starts or ends is the right time.
* Respect time and contributions.

As everyone in the unConference is a participant, participation in different session events may be different. There are several different modes of participation:
* **Lead Participant**: people leading the discussion (also called presenters);
* **Facilitators**: people who have been selected as session facilitators, moderators, and discussants;
* **Participants**: people in the room who will be joining in the discussion.

### Self-Running Sessions

Participants can self-run sessions by:

	1.	Assigning Moderators: Select one or multiple moderators to guide the discussion and ensure it stays on track.
	2.	Assigning a Note Taker: Choose a note taker to document key points and follow-up actions. Notes can be shared during a retrospective at the end of the day.

### Unconference kickoff
The kickoff is the first part of the Unconference and consists of the following steps:

	1.	**Intro**: Introduce the topic, rules, and participation guide.
	2.	**Session Proposals**: Participants propose topics on sticky notes.
	3.	**Session Pitches**: Proposals are explained, merged, and co-leaders identified.
	4.	**Voting**: Participants vote on topics; sessions are scheduled based on votes.
	5.	**Scheduling**: Host schedules sessions; participants break before the first session.

### The Wall (aka: the agenda)
* A living agenda where topics are posted and updated.
* Sessions are typically 20-30 minutes with 10-minute breaks.
